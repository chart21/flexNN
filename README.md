FlexNN is a templated C++ inference engine forked from SimpleNN.
- Implements all layers required to evaluate ResNets and Convolutional Neural Networks.
- Models and datasets can be imported from PyTorch from as .bin files using [PyGEON](https://github.com/chart21/pygeon)
- New Model architectures can be added in `architectures.hpp`
